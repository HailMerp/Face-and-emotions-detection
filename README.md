# Face-and-emotions-detection
Set of functions and programs detecting human faces and emotions using PCA algorithm.
In this project I used pictures of humna faces. Each subject had 10 pictures in overall - 6 pictures of face from different angles and 4 pictures of faces showing different emotions - fear, joy, anger and wonder.
When using algorithms and programs from this repository remember to set two folders of your own pictures - a learning_data_folder
and a test_data_folder -> both can be set by writing a different path in Detecting_faces.m file.
